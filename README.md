# responsive
I am building a responsive website and in this read me file I am going to be documenting every step to make sure I understand after what it is I have done.

The header section has an id of banner and inside it has the image of the logo, underneath that is a div banner text, with a h1 and a p element then another div for the buttons with 2 a links and a span inside each one.

I applied the font poppins to everything and put a margin and padding of 0 on everything.

On the section "banner" I put this background image with this gradient background: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.5),#009688),url(images/banner.jpg);

It covers the whole size of the background and it is positioned in the center. It is the entire height.

The logo width was set in an absolute position with a top and a left value in %.

The banner text is centered, white and has padding on top.

The h1 element inside this has a font size and Kaushan font set.

The p emlement inside this is italic and font size is set.

The buttons are margin 70px auto 0.

The links inside have a width they are inline block, and made into a button with margin,padding etc, in a relative position, z index 1, with a transition

The spans are no width with height absolute no top or bottom, white z -1 with a transition.

when hovered the width is 100% a hover then span
 
then just a hover color is black
