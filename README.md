# responsive
I am building a responsive website and in this read me file I am going to be documenting every step to make sure I understand after what it is I have done.

Step 1) I have linked to the background image in my css and I have set the height to 100vh in order to cover the whole screen. I have positioned it in the center and I have made the size to cover.

Step 2)I then added a linear gradient in the background style with an rgba of 0,0,0,0.5 for the opacity and after that a green color code for the gradient.

Step 3)I then added an image inside the html section for the logo.
